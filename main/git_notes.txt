Create a new repository, it could have any name if is not al ready in use in other own repository.

** First Steps **

cd the directory of the file where I want to use the GitHub repository

git clone <URL> -> Clone a repository into a new directory

git ls -> lists the files in the repository 

git touch <filename> -> create a new file in the repository 

git add <filename> -> add a file to the repository and track it

git commit -m "message" -> save points in the repository 

The message is really important, is the way to identify particular changes in the repository

git push -> Update the repository with the changes I did  to the files in my computer


git commit -am "message" -> add all the files with the changes and provides a message

-am -> provides the git add and the git commit in one line :o

git pull -> Download the recent version of the code to the local repository


** Merge Conflicts ** 

Changes in the same line --> git don't know what to do
Git add meta data to the file to describe the errors of the file
Human intuition have to decide what to do with the changes
Delete other changes , keep both changes, it depends of the situation

After take a decision make a commit and push the changes that solve the merge conflict

** Important commands **

git log -> track every commit in the repository -> give a hash with all the commit with the date and message 

git reset -> revert the repository to an older version 

git reset --hard <commit> -> get back to a particular commit

git reset --hard origin/master -> reset my copy of the repository to the same that is in GitHub

** Branching ** 

git branch -> tell me what branch I'm working on and what branches exists in the repository

git checkout -b <name> -> add new branch to the repository

git checkout master -> switch between branches in the repository
git checkout <name> -> change the code in VS code :o 

** Merge branching **

On the master branch we type the command git merge to merge the different branches
git merge <name>

Probably we have to solve some merge conflicts in the update file with the changes 


** Fork **

Forking mean making your own copy of the original repository

To collaborate in a open source repository I could make a pull request and it will be check out to find out if is a good contribution or not. 


** GitHub Pages **

Create GitHub pages for free --> create a new repository with the name 

Username.github.io -> automatic supported by GitHub pages, it will give a link to look the website
